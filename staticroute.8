.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a utility used to manage static routes via the
.Xr staticrouted 8
daemon.
.Pp
The benefit of this tool over
.Xr route 8
is that the latter creates routes that will be destroyed by the OS X
System Configuration subsystem whenever it decides to reconfigure the network
settings.  By contrast, the
.Xr staticrouted 8
daemon integrates with System Configuration and will automatically create and
destroy routes as and when necessary.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility provides four commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It Cm list-services
List available network services.
.It Cm list
List all configured static routes.
.It Cm add
Add a route.
.It Cm delete
Delete a specific route.
.El
.Pp
The
.Cm list-services
command has no additional arguments.
.Pp
The
.Cm list
command has the syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Nm
.Cm list
.Op Ar network-service
.Ed
.Pp
If the optional
.Ar network-service
argument is provided, the
.Cm list
command will list only those routes associated with the specified service.
.Pp
The
.Cm add
command has the syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Nm
.Cm add
.Ar address
.Ar network-service
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Ar address
is an IPv4 or IPv6 address, optionally with a prefix length.  So 10.1.2.3
would be a valid address, representing a single host, while 10.1.2.0/24
represents the network with address 10.1.2 (IP addresses 10.1.2.0 to 10.1.2.255).
.Ar network-service
is the name of a network service, as listed by the
.Cm list-services
command.
.Pp
The
.Cm add
command takes effect immediately, assuming that the associated network service
is enabled and has a gateway address of the appropriate type.  Unlike the
.Xr route 8
command, the effect of the
.Cm add
command is persistent... configured routes will remain configured across
reboots and will be brought up and torn down along with the appropriate
network service.
.Pp
The
.Cm delete
command has the syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
.Nm
.Cm delete
.Ar address
.Ar network-service
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Ar address
and
.Ar network-service
are the same as for the
.Cm add
command.
.Pp
Like the
.Cm add
command, the
.Cm delete
command takes effect immediately and, again, its effects are persistent.
