.Nm
is a daemon that watches the System Configuration database and automatically
configures static routes as network interfaces go up or down.
.Pp
Conventionally on UNIX-like systems, static routes have been configured in
script files that are triggered by the system's networking scripts.  On OS X,
this doesn't happen---instead, System Configuration is responsible for
configuring network interfaces and routes.  Unfortunately, this means that
using the
.Xr route 8
command to set up static routes will result in routes that last only until the
next time System Configuration re-does the network configuration.  Prior to
OS X 10.6, there was an unofficial mechanism by which System Configuration
could be persuaded to run a script, providing a way to configure static
routes after System Configuration had finished resetting the routing table.
Unfortunately this unofficial support was removed in OS X 10.6, leaving no
robust way to configure static routes on OS X.
.Pp
.Nm
provides a solution to this problem by integrating with System Configuration.
It is started automatically via
.Xr launchd 8
and management of static routes is performed via the
.Xr staticroute 8
command.
